							<h2>UX Projects</h2>
							<p id="ux">The use of user emotions within the design development of software, has been included more frequently with current projects. I’ve implementing UX within some of my design projects. This allowed me to experience the difference between good and bad UX design. Bellow are the name and synopsis of the projects. If you would like to know more about these project chuck me an email given within the footer, and I’d be glad to discuss them.</p>

								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Agile</h3>
									<p>Within my degree I wasn't only taught how to develope within an agile framework. Multiple courses had assignments based on developing my own theoretical agile spaces. This included learning the history of software method transitions between waterfall to agile.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Travel Pack</h3>
									<p>Travel Pack was the first real application I developed on a mobile. Although the testing periods we were conducting, were testing for incorret ideologies that didnt help the app at all. I learned from this project the most.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Prototyping</h3>
									<p>Every semester we had to learn the importance of prototyping, whether it being low or high fidelity. Including digital and physical systems, we were all task to obtain data that gave us insight on how to improve products.</p>

							<h2>Developer Projects</h2>
							<p id="dev">Coding has always been my strong point, when implementing systems. Although my degree states I majored in Software “Design”. This included the technical side of software, which involes learning C, C#, Java and even the basics of microcontrollers. Bellow are the skills and projects I’ve done that shows my developing background.</p>
